# ORIGINAL DATA

The following link is for the original data that has not been tampered with in any way. [""](Zenodo Link UTI Classification Dataset Original Untampered)

# STRUCTURED DATA

The link for just structured data is here, you can use the split ipynb files to split it on your own. The data is copied over to an output folder. Running the script again erases the split and gives you a new output dataset with a different split.

once you download the dataset, it has to be in the same folder name underneath data. if unsure, put the folder exactly where you see this README.md file.
